## Compilation Guide

### Dependancy

XeLaTeX(Packages are listed in tex file), Pygments(For minted package to syntax highlight in code)

XeLaTeX can be obtained by installing LaTeX distribution on your device, for which [Tex Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) are recommanded.

[Pygments](https://pygments.org/) can be install by `pip` or package manager of your choice.
#### Using pip
```bash
pip install Pygments
```
#### Using Homebrew
```bash
brew install pygments
```

### Compilation

In the directory `./LaTeX`, compile the `templates.tex` file using

```bash
make
```
If you encounter mistakes about pygmentize, it is posible that the flag "-shell-escape" is left or you didn't configure the path for pygments properly.
